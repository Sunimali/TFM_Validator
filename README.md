# TFM_Validator


**TFM Validator** is a deep learningâ€“based evaluation framework for **Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) Readouts**.  
It automatically detects inaccurate traction force estimations in traction maps by comparing calculated traction forces against baseline ground truth. The framework is designed to improve the reliability and scalability of traction force analysis in mechanobiology research.
